### Privacy Policy — Address Map Popup
Effective date: 2025-09-02

This Privacy Policy explains how the Address Map Popup Chrome extension (“Extension”, “we”, “us”) collects, uses, and shares information. By using the Extension, you agree to this policy.

### What data we collect
We DO NOT collect any data from you. However, we temporarily handle the following data, which is not stored by us and only persists in your browser's memory while the popup is visible:
- Selected text (user-provided): When you highlight text on a webpage, the Extension temporarily reads that text to determine if it looks like an address or coordinates and, if so, to display a map preview. This text is not stored by us and only persists in memory while the popup is visible.
- Google Maps API key (user-provided): If you enter an API key in the Extension’s popup, it is saved locally using Chrome’s sync storage to enable embedded Google Maps. It remains only in your browser's memory until you delete it or uninstall the Extension.
- No other data: We do not collect browsing history, cookies, credentials, or any other personal data. We do not use analytics, tracking, or advertising technologies.

### How we use the data
- Selected text: Used solely to generate an embedded Google Maps search for your immediate preview.
- API key: Used only to authenticate requests to the Google Maps Embed API.
- No profiling: We do not create user profiles or perform any cross-site tracking.

### Sharing and disclosure
- With Google Maps: When a map preview is shown, the selected text and your API key are sent to Google via the embedded map URL to render results. See the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
- No sale or sharing with others: We do not sell, rent, or share your data with any third parties beyond the embedded request to Google Maps.

### Where processing happens
- On-device processing: Address detection and UI behavior run locally in your browser.
- Network requests: Only the embedded Google Maps frame loads from Google using the selected text and your API key.

### Data retention and deletion
- Selected text: Not stored by us; discarded when the popup closes.
- API key: Stored in Chrome sync storage until you remove it. You can delete it anytime in the Extension’s popup or by uninstalling the Extension.
- Uninstall: Removing the Extension deletes all data stored by it in your browser.

### Permissions we request (and why)
- `activeTab`: To read the currently highlighted text and decide whether to show the map pin/popup.
- `storage`: To save and load your Google Maps API key via Chrome’s storage.

### Security
We rely on Chrome’s extension security model and Chrome sync storage. We do not operate our own servers. Still, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. Protect your API key and revoke it if you suspect misuse.

### Children’s privacy
The Extension is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

### Changes to this policy
We may update this policy from time to time. Material changes will be reflected by updating the “Effective date” above.
